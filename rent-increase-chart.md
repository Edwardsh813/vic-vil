# Victorian Village 3-Year Rent Increase Plan

## 3-Year Incremental Plan

| Unit Type | Current | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 BR | $525 | $585 (+$60) | $640 (+$55) | $700 (+$60) |
| 2 BR | $650 | $735 (+$85) | $815 (+$80) | $900 (+$85) |
| Townhouse | $750 | $835 (+$85) | $915 (+$80) | $1,000 (+$85) |

## Monthly Revenue by Year

| Year | Monthly Rent | Annual Rent | Cumulative Gain |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Current | $61,200 | $734,400 | — |
| Year 1 | $71,520 | $858,240 | +$123,840 |
| Year 2 | $81,320 | $975,840 | +$365,280 |
| Year 3 | $83,200 | $998,400 | +$629,280 |

## Unit Breakdown

- **1 BR:** 40 units
- **2 BR:** 48 units
- **Townhouse:** 12 units
- **Total:** 100 units

## Why Incremental is Better

1. **Lower turnover** - Big jumps (35%+) cause move-outs; 10-12% annual increases are more digestible
2. **Market testing** - You'll see how tenants respond before committing to premium pricing
3. **Gradual market positioning** - Gives you time to upgrade units to justify higher rents
4. **Less vacancy loss** - Turnover costs ~1-2 months rent per unit; avoiding it pays for itself

## Risk of Going Straight to Target

- 35% increase could trigger significant move-outs
- Target 2BR ($900) is above current market - may struggle to fill vacancies
- Nelsonville tenant base may not support premium pricing yet

## Market Comparison (as of January 2026)

| Unit Type | Your Target | Nelsonville Market |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 BR | $700 | $590-$606 avg |
| 2 BR | $900 | $625-$824 avg |
| Townhouse | $1,000 | Limited data |

## Recommendation

Do the 3-year phase-in. Year 1 gets you to market rate, Years 2-3 push into premium territory as you can justify it with upgrades or market shifts.
